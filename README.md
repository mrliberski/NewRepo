# TrainingRecord

My old simple Excel Macro based MS Forms GUI to strore and manage trainign information in MSAccess DB. Information stored are FLT truck licence validity dates for each person.

Additional script generates a html table in browser which shows training status for each person and alerts when their licence will expire by changing colour of cells.
